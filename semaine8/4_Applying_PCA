# Reconstruction from Compressed Representation #


   _ Method:

			_ Xapprox = Ureduce * z


# Choosing the Number of PC#

  _ Goal:

		_ Choosing k.


  _ Important feature:


  		_1 Average squared projection error: (1/m) ((m sum i = 1) ||x{i} - Xapprox{i}||{2})

		_2 Total variation in the data: (1/m) ((m sum i=0) ||x{i}||{2})

		_ Typically, choose k to be smallet value so that:

		  			_ 1/2 <= 00.1

		_ "99% of variance is retained"
