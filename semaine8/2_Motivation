# Motivation I: Data Compression #

  _ Goal: Reduce the computational power needed ? 

  _ Data Compression:


  		 _ Reduce data from 2D to 1D
		   |-> use the linear line from the 2D plan to make a new plane ?

		 _ Reduce data from 3D to 2D
		   |-> same, projection the 3d data that are not on the
		      principal 2D plane made by the rest of the data
			  to get the new 2D plane ?

# Motivation I: Visualization #

  _ Goal: Visualize our data ?


  _ Data vizualisation:

  		 _ Combine our feature with dimensional reduction
		   so we can plot our data on 2D planes.
