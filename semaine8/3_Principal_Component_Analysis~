# PCA Problem Formulation #


  _ PCA problem formulation:

  		_ Example:

		  _ we have 2 features x[1], x[2] that we can plot
		  	on a 2D plane.

        _ Goal:

		  _ we need to compute the equation of the linear axe that fit/minimize
			our data to use it as our new 1D plan.
		  _ we use PCA to compute the equation.

		  -->  Reduce from n-dimension to k-dimension: find k verctors u.

		_ Notation:

		  _ u{i} <-- projection vector thta minimize the distance with the data

		  _ n <-- dimension/feature of the data
		  _ K <--- dimension/feature of the compressed data

  _ PCA is not linear regression:


  		_ Explaination:

			_ Linear regression:

				_ we are minimizing the square error
				  (Andrew drawing vertical line between the line and the data)

				_ we are trying to predict y

		    _ PCA:

				_ we are minimizing the magnitude ?
				  (Andrew drawing perpendicular line between the line and the data)

				_ we are treating feature equally, symetrically.
