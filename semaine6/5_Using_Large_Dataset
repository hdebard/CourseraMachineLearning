# Data For Machine Learning #


 _ Goal:
		_ Designing a high accuracy learning system


 _ Example:

		_ Classify between confusable words.

		_ Algorthim:

			_ Percepton (Logistic regression)

			_ Winnow

			_ Memory-based

			_ Naive Bayes


  _ Quote: _ "It's not who has the best algorithm that wins.
  		   	 	   	   	   It's who has the most data."


  _ Large data rationale:

  		  _ Assume feature x has sufficient information to
		  	predict y accurately.

		  _ x has not always sufficient information.

		  _ given feature x, can human expert confidently predict y ?



		_ Use a learning algorithm with many parameters (logistic/linear reggression
		  with many features; neural network with many hidden units) <-- low bias algorithm
		  	   --> J[train](theta) will be smal

		_ Use a very large training set (unlikely to overfit) <-- low variance
		  	   --> J[train](theta) almost equat to J[test](theta)


		|--->  Using these two method, J[train](theta) will be small
