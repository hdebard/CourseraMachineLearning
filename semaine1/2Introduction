# Welcome #

		Machine Learning:

						- Grew out of work in AI

						- New capability for computers

		Examples:

						- Database mining:
									_ Large datasets from growth of automation/web
									_ E.g., Web click data, medical records, biology, engineering

						_ Applications can\'t program by hand,
						  			_ E.g., Autnomous helicopter, handwriting regognitions, most of NLP, CV

						_ Self-customizing programs
						  			_ E.g., Amazon, Netflix product recommenations
						_ Understanding human learning (brain, real AI).


# Supervised Learning #

  		Examples:
					1 _ Predict house prising

					2 _ Predict breast cancer
		Techniques:

					1 - Regression: (Discrete fonction ?)

							_ Linear reggression ? Polynomial reggression ?


					2 _ Classification (Discrete value output ?)

							_ Type 0 or 1 ?  Type 0 .... x ?

					;; HOW TO DEAL WITH INFINITE NUMBERS ? SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE


#  Unsupervised Learning #


   		Examples:

					1 _ Predict breast cancer, Google News, Genome

					1 _ Organize computing clusters, Social network analysis,
					  			 Market segmenttion, Astronomical data analysis

					2 _ Cocktail Party problem (example: separate 2 voice from the same audio file)
		Techniques:


					1 _ Clustering (data aren\'t classified and the algorithm clusters data)

					2 _ Cocktail Party Algorythm ;;;CQFD

					;; [W,s,v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1),size(x,1),1).*x)*x'); (Octave ?)
					;;           |-> singular value decomposition
