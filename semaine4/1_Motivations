# Non-linear Hypotheses #



  _ Non-linear Classification:


  			   _ Classification problem:

			   	 		_ Will the house been sell in the next weeks ?

						   _ Logistic regression:

						  	   _ If we have many features, if you had quadratic terms
							   	 you will get a lage nbr of parameters and you will
								 overfitting.

							   _ you can try to include less quatratric:
							   	 	 _ only suare parameters but you will
							   	 	   not have enough term to fit the data

									 _ only cubic term, you will have too many terms

				_ Exemple: 

				  		  _ computer vison, is the picture is a car ?
				  		   	 	_ the computer only compute pixels
								_ 50 * 50 pixel = 2500
								_ vector x {2500} with value between 0-255
				
								_ If we use our regression model,
								  we will have (x[i] * x[j]) quatric features
								  	 	  	   |-> 3 million in these case
											   	   |-> seems legit to calcul
												   	   	|-> never go full retard pls

	_ Resume:
				_ you can't calcul hypotethis for complex problem like computer vision
				  	  			   		 |->CQFD	  
				_ Neural Network are way better <--- CQFD
				  		 		 	CQFD ---|--> CQFD
										   CQFD

# Neurons and the Brain #

  _ Origins:

		_ Mimic the brain

		_ Widely 80s-90s then diminished because
		   --->>> computationally expensive

  _ Representation:

		_ to mimic the brain we will need a lot of different
		  piece of algorythm <--- False

		_ The brain have just "one lerning algorythm"

		  	  		_ Exemple: if you use audition region of the brain and <-----deal with it
					  		   you cut the audition cable and put the vision cable,
							   these part of the brain will learn to see and
							   you will see like you were seing before
