# Kernels I #

  _ Topic:

		_ Non-linear Decision Boundary:

		  _ Notation:

				_ f[j] = x[j]
				_ l{i} = landmark ??


# Kernels II #

	    _ SVM Parameters:

		  	  _ C ( = 1/m): - Large C: Lower bias, high variance,
			  	  	  		_ Small C: Higher bias, low variance.

			  _ sigma{2}: _ Large: Features f[i] vary more smoothly
			  			  		   Higher bias, low variance. 
			  			  _ Small: Features f[i] vary less smoothly
						  		   Lower bias, high variance.
