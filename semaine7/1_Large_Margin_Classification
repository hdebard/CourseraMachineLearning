  _ Topic:
		  _ Alternative view of logistic regression:

		    		_ h[theta](x) = 1/(1+e{-theta{T}x})
					  											|-> much bigger
					_ If y = 1, we want h[theta](x) =~ 1, O{T}x >> 0
		  	   	 	   	   	 	   					|-> environ

					_ If y = 0, we want h[theta](x) =~ 0, O{T}x << 0


					_ Andrew in drawing straight line fitting curve of
					  logistic regression function, this is supposed
					  to be the SVM.
