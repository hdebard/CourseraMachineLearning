# Using An SVM #

  _ Use a software package to sole parameters theta.

  _ Need to specify:
  		 _ Choice of parameter C
		 _ Choice of kernel (similarity function)
	->   _ No kernel, linear kernel
	->	 _ Gaussian kernel:
		   		_ Note: Do feature scaling before using the GK

		 _ Other kernel:
		   		 _ Polynomial kernel: (X{t}l + const){degree} 
				 _ String kernel, chi-square kernel, histogram
				   intersection kernel.

  _ Multi class classification:

  		  _ Use package with builtin.
		  _ Use one.vs.all method.


  _ Logistic regression vs. SVMs:


  			 _ Notation:
			   _ n = nbr of features
			   _ m = nbr of training examples

			 _ If n is large: lr or svm without kernel

			 _ If n is small, m intermediate: svm with gaussian kernel

			 _ If n is small, m is large: add more featuresand use lr or svm without kernel


			 _ Better use NN but it is slower to train.

			 _ No local optima with SVM.
